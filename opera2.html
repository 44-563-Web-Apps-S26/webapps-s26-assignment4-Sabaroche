        Sir Marmaduke—my dear young friend, Alexis—
        On this most happy, most auspicious plighting—
        Permit me as a true old friend to tender
        My best, my very best congratulations!

    <p class="speech drd">
        May fortune bless you! may the middle distance
        Of your young life be pleasant as the foreground—
        The joyous foreground! and, when you have reached it,
        May that which now is the far-off horizon
        (But which will then become the middle distance),
        In fruitful promise be exceeded only
        By that which will have opened, in the meantime,
        Into a new and glorious horizon!
