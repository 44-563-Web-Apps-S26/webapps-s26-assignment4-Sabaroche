    <h5 class="name">CHORUS OF VILLAGERS</h5>

    <p class = "song chorus">
        Ring forth, ye bells,
              With clarion sound—
        Forget your knells,
              For joys abound.
        Forget your notes
              Of mournful lay,
        And from your throats
              Pour joy to-day.

        For to-day young Alexis—young Alexis Pointdextre
              Is betrothed to Aline—to Aline Sangazure,
        And that pride of his sex is—of his sex is to be next her
              At the feast on the green—on the green, oh, be sure!

        Ring forth, ye bells etc.

    <p class="direction">(Exeunt the men into house.)</p>

    <p class = "speech">
        Constance, my daughter, why this strange depression?
        The village rings with seasonable joy,
        Because the young and amiable Alexis,
        Heir to the great Sir Marmaduke Pointdextre,
        Is plighted to Aline, the only daughter
        Of Annabella, Lady Sangazure.
        You, you alone are sad and out of spirits;
        What is the reason?  Speak, my daughter, speak!
    </p>

    <h5 class="name const">CONST.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">
        Oh, mother, do not ask!  If my complexion
        From red to white should change in quick succession,
        And then from white to red, oh, take no notice!
        If my poor limbs should tremble with emotion,
        Pay no attention, mother—it is nothing!
        If long and deep-drawn sighs I chance to utter,
        Oh, heed them not, their cause must ne'er be known!
    </p>

    <p class="direction">(Mrs. Partlet motions to Chorus to leave her with Constance.  Exeunt ladies of Chorus.)</p>

    <h5 class="name">ARIA—CONSTANCE</h5>

    <p class = "song">
        When he is here,
             I sigh with pleasure—
        When he is gone,
             I sigh with grief.
        My hopeless fear
             No soul can measure—
        His love alone
             Can give my aching heart relief!

        When he is cold,
             I weep for sorrow—
        When he is kind,
             I weep for joy.
        My grief untold
             Knows no to-morrow—
        My woe can find
             No hope, no solace, no alloy!

    <h5 class="name mrsp">MRS. P.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">
        Come, tell me all about it!  Do not fear—
        I, too, have loved; but that was long ago!
        Who is the object of your young affections?
    </p>

    <h5 class="name const">CONST.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">Hush, mother!  He is here!  (Looking off)</p>

    <p class="direction">(Enter Dr. Daly.  He is pensive and does not see them.)</p>

    <h5 class="name mrsp">MRS. P.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">(amazed)  Our reverend vicar!</p>

    <h5 class="name const">CONST.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">Oh, pity me, my heart is almost broken!</p>

    <h5 class="name mrsp">MRS. P.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">
        My child, be comforted.  To such an union
        I shall not offer any opposition.
        Take him—he's yours!  May you and he be happy!
    </p>

    <h5 class="name const">CONST.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">But, mother dear, he is not yours to give!</p>

    <h5 class="name mrsp">MRS. P.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">That's true, indeed!</p>

    <h5 class="name const">CONST.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">He might object!</p>

    <h5 class="name mrsp">MRS. P.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">
        He might.
        But come—take heart—I'll probe him on the subject.
        Be comforted—leave this affair to me.
    </p>

    <p class="direction">(They withdraw.)</p>

    <h5 class="name">RECITATIVE—DR. DALY</h5>

    <p class = "speech">
        The air is charged with amatory numbers—
              Soft madrigals, and dreamy lovers' lays.
        Peace, peace, old heart!  Why waken from its slumbers
              The aching memory of the old, old days?
    </p>

    <h5 class = "name">BALLAD</h5>

    <p class = "song">
        Time was when Love and I were well acquainted.
              Time was when we walked ever hand in hand.
        A saintly youth, with worldly thought untainted,
              None better-loved than I in all the land!
        Time was, when maidens of the noblest station,
              Forsaking even military men,
        Would gaze upon me, rapt in adoration—
              Ah me, I was a fair young curate then!

        Had I a headache? sighed the maids assembled;
              Had I a cold? welled forth the silent tear;
        Did I look pale? then half a parish trembled;
              And when I coughed all thought the end was near!
        I had no care—no jealous doubts hung o'er me—
              For I was loved beyond all other men.
        Fled gilded dukes and belted earls before me—
              Ah me, I was a pale young curate them!
    </p>

    <p class="direction">(At the conclusion of the ballad, Mrs. Partlet comes forward with Constance.)</p>

    <h5 class="name mrsp">MRS. P.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">Good day, reverend sir.</p>

    <h5 class="name drd">DR. D.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">Ah, good Mrs. Partlet, I am glad to see you.  And your little daughter, Constance! 
       Why, she is quite a little woman, I declare!</p>

    <h5 class="name const">CONST.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">(aside)  Oh, mother, I cannot speak to him!</p>

    <h5 class="name mrsp">MRS. P.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">Yes, reverend sir, she is nearly eighteen, and as good a girl as ever stepped. 
       (Aside to Dr. Daly)  Ah, sir, I'm afraid I shall soon lose her!</p>

    <h5 class="name drd">DR. D.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">(aside to Mrs. Partlet)  Dear me, you pain me very much.  Is she delicate?</p>

    <h5 class="name mrsp">MRS. P.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">Oh no, sir—I don't mean that—but young girls look to get married.</p>

    <h5 class="name drd">DR. D.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">Oh, I take you.  To be sure.  But there's plenty of time for that. 
       Four or five years hence, Mrs. Partlet, four or five years hence.  
       But when the time does come, I shall have much pleasure in marrying her myself—</p>

    <h5 class="name const">CONST.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">(aside)  Oh, mother!</p>

    <h5 class="name drd">DR. D.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">To some strapping young fellow in her own rank of life.</p>

    <h5 class="name const">CONST.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">(in tears)  He does not love me!</p>

    <h5 class="name mrsp">MRS. P.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">I have often wondered, reverend sir (if you'll excuse the liberty), that you have never married.</p>

    <h5 class="name drd">DR. D.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">(aside)  Be still, my fluttering heart!</p>

    <h5 class="name mrsp">MRS. P.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">A clergyman's wife does so much good in a village.
        Besides that, you are not as young as you were, and before very long you will want somebody to nurse you, and look after your little comforts.</p>

    <h5 class="name drd">DR. D.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">
      Mrs. Partlet, there is much truth in what you say. 
       I am indeed getting on in years, and a helpmate would cheer my declining days.
         Time was when it might have been; but I have left it too long—I am an old fogy, now, am I not, my dear? 
         (to Constance)—a very old fogy, indeed.  Ha! ha!  No, Mrs. Partlet, my mind is quite made up. 
          I shall live and die a solitary old bachelor.
      </p>

    <h5 class="name const">CONST.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">(sobs on Mrs. Partlet's bosom)  Oh, mother, mother!</p>

    <h5 class="name mrsp">MRS. P.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">Come, come, dear one, don't fret.  At a more fitting time we will try again—we will try again.</p>

    <p class = "direction">(Exeunt Mrs. Partlet and Constance.)</p>

    <h5 class="name drd">DR. D.</h5>
    <p class = "speech">(looking after them)  Poor little girl!  I'm afraid she has something on her mind.  She is rather comely.  Time was when this old heart would have throbbed in double-time at the sight of such a fairy form!  But tush!  I am puling!  Here comes the young Alexis with his proud and happy father.  Let me dry this tell-tale tear!</p>
